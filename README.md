Spotted these (No pun intended) and thought they might be fun to try.....using C instead of Java might make them a little more challenging except for the third one that should be 1 operation either way.

## 1. Cat vs. Dog
Choosing the maximum number of people that can be satisfied when voting on a reality tv show. The people will vote each week choosing 1 cat or dog to stay and one to leave. A cat lover is defined as a dog hater and vice versa

## 2. Zipfâ€™s Song
Song ordering using Zipf's frequency algorithm. The likelihood of i occuring is 1 divided by position in a set. This means that the "quality" of something in a set where every option can be considered equal is the number of times it actually occured multiplied by it's position in the set.

## 3. Reversed Binary Numbers
When considering a number as binary flip the bits. Can be one operation (^ or not, whichever you want to call it), but here is a more long winded way of getting to the same thing.  

Sample input 1
13

Sample output 1
11

Sample input 2
47

Sample output 2
